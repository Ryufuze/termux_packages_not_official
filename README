For "on device" buildilg. Tremux package builder for termux 0.101 with bash 5.2.2

I had bugs popping up on my device when use official version, so I decided to fix it and make a working version of package_builder. This script successfully compiled binutils. The series of compilations does not detach from the official version https://github.com/termux/termux-packages. 
For building do:
    cd /path/to/your/termux_packages_not_official/directory
    bash ./build-package.sh name_of_package

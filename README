For "on device" building. Tremux package builder for termux 0.101 with bash 5.2.2

I had bugs popping up on my device when use official version, so I decided to fix it and make a working version of package_builder. This script successfully compiled binutils. The series of compilations does not detach from the official version https://github.com/termux/termux-packages. 

For installing everything you need do:
    cd /PATH/TO/YOUR/TERMUX_PACKAGES_NOT_OFFICIAL/DIRECTORY/scripts
    bash ./setup-termux.sh

For building package do:
    cd /PATH/TO/YOUR/TERMUX_PACKAGES_NOT_OFFICIAL/DIRECTORY/
    bash ./build-package.sh NAME_OF_PACKAGE
